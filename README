DISTRIBUTION
LORE is distributed an an XPI file (Firefox extension).

The extension can be installed into Firefox by opening the XPI via File > Open 
or dragging the file onto the Browser.
See http://www.itee.uq.edu.au/~eresearch/projects/aus-e-lit/demos.php for video demos

DEVELOPMENT
I use eclipse with Spket IDE http://spket.com/ for development of LORE
Use ant (dist-nojar) to build the XPI file

You can point Firefox directly at the eclipse project during development.
We recommend setting up a new profile for development (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Setting_up_extension_development_environment)
Create a text file named lore@maenad.itee.uq.edu.au in your Firefox profile extension directory eg
C:\Documents and Settings\(username)\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\(profile name)\extensions
The contents of that text file should be the location of the oaiorebuilder project eg
C:\Workspace\oaiorebuilder

If you want to see LORE debug output, you'll need Firebug and Chromebug installed in your development profile.
I'm currently using Firebug 1.4X.5 and Chromebug 1.5.0a6
The X in Firebug is important - it has tracing enabled. You can get it from here:
